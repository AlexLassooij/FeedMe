# SlackApp

An app for the Slack workspace that is invoked by a user command. By taking in parameters for user preferences (e.g. budget, time available), it facilitates the process of deciding where to get your next meal. This application was started as a project during the 2021 Hack the 6ix hackathon and is currently still under development by myself.
