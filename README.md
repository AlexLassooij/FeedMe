# SlackApp

An app for the Slack workspace that is invoked by a user command. By taking in parameters for user preferences (e.g. budget, time available), it facilitates the process of deciding where to get your next meal. This application was started as a project during the 2021 Hack the 6ix hackathon and is currently still under development by myself.

So far, it allows the user to find nearby restaurant based on their current location :
